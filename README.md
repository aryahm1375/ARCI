# Contrastive Learning on Medical Intents for Sequential Prescription Recommendation

This code corresponds to the paper titled "Contrastive Learning on Medical Intents for Sequential Prescription Recommendation" It serves as a resource for understanding the development of ARCI and the interconnections between layers in the deep learning architecture. By examining this code, one can gain insights into the implementation details and gain a comprehensive understanding of ARCI's functionality.
